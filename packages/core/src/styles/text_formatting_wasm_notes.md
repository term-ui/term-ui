# Text Formatting WASM Build Notes

This document provides notes on issues identified and fixed for the text formatting features in the WASM build.

## Key Findings

1. **Parsing Inconsistency**: The parsing of `line_through` vs `line-through` was inconsistent. Using `line-through` consistently solved the issue.

2. **Float Conversions**: Careful handling of float-to-int conversions is essential for WASM compatibility. Always use explicit type conversions with methods like `@floatFromInt` and `@intFromFloat` with appropriate rounding (`@round`, `@floor`, `@ceil`) when needed.

3. **Function Return Values**: In WASM, be careful with function returns that might be `try` expressions - use explicit error handling.

4. **Object Initialization**: For functions like `Style.init()`, WASM requires removing the `try` keyword when the function doesn't return an error.

## Tests Created

The following tests were created to help identify and prevent WASM-related issues:

- `test_decoration_parsing`: Tests the text decoration parser with various formats and values.
- `font_weight_parsing`: Tests the font weight parser with all supported values.
- `font_style_parsing`: Tests the font style parser with all supported values.
- `basic_style_inheritance`: Tests style inheritance through the tree structure.
- `textformat_conversion`: Tests conversion from style properties to text format.
- `canvas_formatting`: Tests the drawing of formatted text in the Canvas.
- `style_copying`: Tests copying styles from one style object to another.
- `float_conversions`: Tests float-to-int conversions that might be problematic in WASM.

## WASM-Specific Issues

The most common WASM-specific issues identified were:

1. String handling - using constants and proper string replacement for parsing.
2. Float-point conversions - extra care needed in WASM for float/int conversions.
3. Error handling - WASM is more sensitive to error union types and proper error handling.

## Running the Tests

Run specific tests using:

```
zig build debugbuild -Dtest-filter="basic_style_inheritance" && ./zig-out/bin/test
```

Run all tests using:

```
zig build test
```

## Recommended Fixes for Similar Issues

1. When adding new text decoration types, ensure the enum name and string representation are consistent.
2. Always use explicit type conversions for floats and integers.
3. Test both native and WASM builds to catch platform-specific issues early.
4. For string parsing, provide helpful error messages and fallbacks.
